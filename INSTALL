Prerequisites
-------------

In order to compile and use zfs-fuse, you need the following:

 * Linux kernel 2.6.x (2.6.15 or later recommended).

 * FUSE 2.8.x or greater

   You will need the fuse, fuse-utils and/or libfuse packages
(and associated -dev packages), depending on the distribution.

 * scons
 * libfuse-dev (>= 2.8.1)
 * zlib1g-dev
 * libaio-dev
 * libssl-dev
 * libattr1-dev

For building a debian package, you need debhelper (>= 7.0.50~)

Currently, it only works on the x86, amd64 and powerpc (untested)
architectures.

In order to use pools created on Solaris, you will probably need kernel
support for GPT/EFI partitions. EVMS is highly recommended in this case,
see http://evms.sourceforge.net

Compiling
---------

If you don't have SCons yet, do the usual 'sudo apt-get install scons',
'emerge scons' or 'yum install scons'.

To compile follow these steps:

  1) cd src
  2) scons

That's it!
The recommended flags for packaging are

  scons debug=1 optim=-O2

That way, you won't have the debug asserts (which _will_ fire in known
situations where recoverery would be possible; you don't want to enable debug
asserts if you want to have a resilient zfs-fuse setup). But the binaries will
have debug info attached. In most distributions it is customary to strip
binaries, but keep the versions with symbols so you can interpret stack traces
'from the wild'.

If the compilation fails, please report a bug. See http://zfs-fuse.net/issues

Manpage
-------
If you want to update the zfs-fuse man page, edit doc/zfs-fuse.man.xml and run
(on a debian-like host)

	apt-get install xsltproc docbook-xml docbook-xsl
	make -C doc/

Installing
----------

To install, run 'scons install' with appropriate privileges. It will
install the binaries in /usr/local/sbin by default.

Run 'scons install install_dir=/path/to/dir' if you want to install it in
another directory.
